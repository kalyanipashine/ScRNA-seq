ScRNA-sequencing:
Single-Cell RNA-Seq provides transcriptional profiling of thousands of individual cells. 
This level of throughput analysis enables researchers to understand at the single-cell level what genes are expressed, 
in what quantities, and how they differ across thousands of cells within a heterogeneous sample.


Analysis:
Analysis is done using R.
where we used the Seurat R package for analysis.
A toolkit for quality control, analysis, and exploration of single cell RNA sequencing data. 
Seurat aims to enable users to identify and interpret sources of heterogeneity from single cell transcriptomic measurements, 
and to integrate diverse types of single cell data.
