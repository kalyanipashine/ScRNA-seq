Single cell-RNA sequencing
Single-Cell RNA-Seq provides transcriptional profiling of thousands of individual cells. 
This level of throughput analysis enables researchers to understand at the single-cell level what genes are expressed, 
in what quantities, and how they differ across thousands of cells within a heterogeneous sample.
